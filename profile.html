				<div class="introduction">
					<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">&emsp;&ensp;My name is Jericho Javier, a 21-year-old living in Del Rosario, Tiaong, Quezon. I pursued an academic track in ICT during my secondary education at Batangas Eastern Colleges, and I am currently a third-year BSIT student at the San Pablo City campus of Laguna State Polytechnic University of the Philippines. My dream is to become a successful programmer and develop software that can solve real-world problems. I find coding to be both challenging and rewarding, and the idea of creating something from scratch that can make people's lives easier is something that I am very passionate about. I believe that with hard work and dedication, I can achieve my dream and make a positive impact in the world through programming.</p>

				<div class="music">
					<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">As a music lover, I believe that listening to music is one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling experiences one can have. Music has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions, from happiness and joy to sadness and melancholy. It can transport us to different times and places, and connect us to people and cultures that we may not have otherwise known about. Listening to music is also a great way to unwind and relax after a long day, and can help us to de-stress and clear our minds. Whether I'm listening to my favorite band or discovering new music, the experience of listening to music always feels like a journey that I am happy to take.</p>

				<div class="anime">
					<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">As a big fan of anime, I can confidently say that watching anime is a unique and immersive experience that I truly enjoy. Anime has a way of telling stories that captivates its audience, whether it's through its beautiful animation, complex characters, or intricate plot lines. It can transport me to another world, one that's filled with magic, action, romance, or anything in between. I love how anime can make me feel a wide range of emotions, from excitement and joy to sadness and heartbreak. The characters in anime often feel like real people with their own distinct personalities, motivations, and struggles, making it easy to become emotionally invested in their stories. Whether I'm binge-watching a new series or re-watching an old favorite, the experience of watching anime always feels like a journey that I'm happy to be a part of.</p>

Playing games is also a great way to socialize with friends and connect with other gamers around the world, whether it's through online multiplayer or local co-op. I appreciate the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that comes with overcoming challenges and achieving goals in a game, and the sense of community that can develop around certain titles.
